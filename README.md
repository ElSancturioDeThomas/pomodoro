# Pomodoro Timer

A React-based Pomodoro timer built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Features a large digital clock display with Orbitron font, session management (work, short break, long break), start/stop controls, reset functionality, and integrated task management. Users can add tasks, mark them complete with strikethrough, and delete completed items. The timer automatically cycles through 25-minute work sessions, 5-minute short breaks, and 30-minute long breaks after every third pomodoro.
